# Brain-Segmentation
This repository contains the code for segmenting brain tissues from a CT scan: cerebrospinal fluid, white matter &amp; gray matter.
It uses several methods:
- Tissue Models
- Label Propagation
- K-means
- Expectation-Maximization
- A combination of these
The segmentation algorithms are evaluation using the DSC scores w.r.t. the ground truth segmentations.
